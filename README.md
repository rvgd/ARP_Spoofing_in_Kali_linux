# ARP_Spoofing_in_Kali_linux
ARP spoofing is a technique where an attacker manipulates the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) by sending specially crafted messages to a local network. The attacker tries to associate a selected MAC address with the IP address of another host.
This tool is very sleak and more straight forward, understandable code with explained commands for better understanding:)

# How to use:
```sh
sudo python ARP_spoofer.py -t [influenser ip] [victim ip]
